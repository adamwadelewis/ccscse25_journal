	abstract = {The success of the large neural language models on many NLP tasks is exciting. However, we find that these successes sometimes lead to hype in which these models are being described as {``}understanding{''} language or capturing {``}meaning{''}. In this position paper, we argue that a system trained only on form has a priori no way to learn meaning. In keeping with the ACL 2020 theme of {``}Taking Stock of Where We{'}ve Been and Where We{'}re Going{''}, we argue that a clear understanding of the distinction between form and meaning will help guide the field towards better science around natural language understanding.},

@inproceedings{sun-etal-2019-mitigating,
	abstract = {As Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools rise in popularity, it becomes increasingly vital to recognize the role they play in shaping societal biases and stereotypes. Although NLP models have shown success in modeling various applications, they propagate and may even amplify gender bias found in text corpora. While the study of bias in artificial intelligence is not new, methods to mitigate gender bias in NLP are relatively nascent. In this paper, we review contemporary studies on recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP. We discuss gender bias based on four forms of representation bias and analyze methods recognizing gender bias. Furthermore, we discuss the advantages and drawbacks of existing gender debiasing methods. Finally, we discuss future studies for recognizing and mitigating gender bias in NLP.},

@inproceedings{raychawdhary-etal-2023-seals,
	abstract = {One of the most extensively researched applications in natural language processing (NLP) is sentiment analysis. While the majority of the study focuses on high-resource languages (e.g., English), this research will focus on low-resource African languages namely Igbo and Hausa. The annotated tweets of both languages have a significant number of code-mixed tweets. The curated datasets necessary to build complex AI applications are not available for the majority of African languages. To optimize the use of such datasets, research is needed to determine the viability of present NLP procedures as well as the development of novel techniques. This paper outlines our efforts to develop a sentiment analysis (for positive and negative as well as neutral) system for tweets from the Hausa, and Igbo languages. Sentiment analysis can computationally analyze and discover sentiments in a text or document. We worked on the first thorough compilation of AfriSenti-SemEval 2023 Shared Task 12 Twitter datasets that are human-annotated for the most widely spoken languages in Nigeria, such as Hausa and Igbo. Here we trained the modern pre-trained language model AfriBERTa large on the AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 Twitter dataset to create sentiment classification. In particular, the results demonstrate that our model trained on AfriSenti-SemEval Shared Task 12 datasets and produced with an F1 score of 80.85{\%} for Hausa and 80.82{\%} for Igbo languages on the sentiment analysis test. In AfriSenti-SemEval 2023 shared task 12 (Task A), we consistently ranked top 10 by achieving a mean F1 score of more than 80{\%} for both the Hausa and Igbo languages.},
