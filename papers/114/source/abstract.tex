%We propose a model to revitalize undergraduate computer science education at the introductory level by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts early in the curriculum. This model aims to enhance students' learning experiences in introductory computer science courses and motivates further study in computing by (1) relating computational thinking concepts like algorithmic reasoning and data representation to real-world problems using AI as a theme, (2) implementing hands-on projects covering real-world applications illustrating core computer science principles and human problem-solving behavior, (3) developing an adaptable framework to teach students to apply computing concepts across a broad range of challenges. The model builds on a successful NSF-funded project that explored a project-based approach to teaching introductory AI courses with a focus on machine learning. The original project yielded positive assessment results published in journals and conference proceedings and presented at multiple computer science education conferences. In this paper, we present the development of a scaffolded model for introducing core computational topics by adapting and scaling down previously developed AI-themed projects. Given the growing demand for computer science graduates equipped to tackle cutting-edge problems and the rapid expansion of AI, it is essential to prepare students with the skills and knowledge needed for the workforce. We believe our work will contribute to pathways for increasing and broadening participation in AI education and the workforce. We present work in progress on our model, sample programming projects tailored for introductory courses, and plans to implement and assess its impact and effectiveness in achieving our goals.

We present a model to enhance introductory computer science (CS) education by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) concepts early in the curriculum. This approach aims to improve student engagement and motivation by (i) connecting computational thinking (e.g., algorithmic reasoning, data representation) to real-world problems through AI, (ii) implementing hands-on projects that illustrate core CS principles and human problem-solving, and (iii) developing an adaptable framework for applying computing concepts across diverse challenges.
