abstract = {As AI-generated code promises to become an increasingly relied upon tool for software developers, there is a temptation to call for significant changes to early computer science curricula. A move from syntax-focused topics in CS1 toward abstraction and high-level application design seems motivated by the new large language models (LLMs) recently made available. In this position paper however, we advocate for an approach more informed by the AI itself - teaching early CS learners not only how to use the tools but also how to better understand them. Novice programmers leveraging AI-code-generation without proper understanding of syntax or logic can create "black box" code with significant security vulnerabilities. We outline methods for integrating basic AI knowledge and traditional software verification steps into CS1 along with LLMs, which will better prepare students for software development in professional settings.},

This poster presents a succinct overview of these developments. Specifically, we look to bring together all publications that might impact the teaching of AI (for example, teacher expectations in the coming years around AI competencies)and publications that affect the use of AI in the classroom. We mean using tools and systems that incorporate both 'Good Old Fashioned 'AI and those that can directly impact students. This poster is of value to both the European and the wider CER communities and practitioners, as it brings together several guidelines, acts, and plans that are not easily searchable or linked. The publications presented in this poster will impact the teaching of AI and teaching with Ai in Europe, and insights can be drawn and compared for other jurisdictions as the educational world adapts to and with AI.},

These approaches can also be applied to computer science education, especially in an introductory course, and with the same benefits.},

While some oppose their use, many researchers have begun to approach the topic of educational AI use from a different perspective. Despite being in its early stages; this field of research has produced notable insights into the capabilities and limitations of models like ChatGPT. This paper utilizes a SWOT analysis framework to analyze and consolidate existing literature, with a specific focus on Computer Science education. Through the analysis of this literature, we have created a set of use cases and guidelines to aid in the future development of strategies and tools within this field. Our findings indicate that while some concerns are valid, such as AI's ability to generate plagiarized work, we identified several promising avenues and opportunities for careful integration of this technology into education.},

abstract = {In Summer 2023, we developed and integrated a suite of AI-based software tools into CS50 at Harvard University. These tools were initially available to approximately 70 summer students, then to thousands of students online, and finally to several hundred on campus during Fall 2023. Per the course's own policy, we encouraged students to use these course-specific tools and limited the use of commercial AI software such as ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and the new Bing. Our goal was to approximate a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio through software, thereby equipping students with a pedagogically-minded subject-matter expert by their side at all times, designed to guide students toward solutions rather than offer them outright. The tools were received positively by students, who noted that they felt like they had "a personal tutor.'' Our findings suggest that integrating AI thoughtfully into educational settings enhances the learning experience by providing continuous, customized support and enabling human educators to address more complex pedagogical issues. In this paper, we detail how AI tools have augmented teaching and learning in CS50, specifically in explaining code snippets, improving code style, and accurately responding to curricular and administrative queries on the course's discussion forum. Additionally, we present our methodological approach, implementation details, and guidance for those considering using these tools or AI generally in education.},

abstract = {Prompt and sufficient feedback is essential for students' academic learning since it enables them to review their learning techniques and improve their areas of weakness. Nevertheless, delivering personalised feedback to every student continues to be difficult&nbsp;for teachers due to its demanding and time-intensive nature. While automated feedback systems are available, their primary focus is providing feedback on a single subject, and most of them utilise statistical analysis or traditional machine learning techniques to provide feedback. Moreover, no feedback model utilises the same criteria to generate text-based feedback for more than one subject. Generative artificial intelligence (GEN AI) has recently made incredible progress, and large language models (LLMs) can retain the context from the vast amount of text. Hence, this research presents a framework that employs an innovative technique to offer text-based feedback to students in different fields of study. This framework employs two LLMs, one for generating the feedback and another for categorising it into separate subjects using suitable headings for structural organising. Consequently, the output produced by this technology corresponds to the original tone of the teacher.},

abstract = {Providing timely and personalized feedback to large numbers of students is a long-standing challenge in programming courses. Relying on human teaching assistants (TAs) has been extensively studied, revealing a number of potential shortcomings. These include inequitable access for students with low confidence when needing support, as well as situations where TAs provide direct solutions without helping students to develop their own problem-solving skills. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), digital teaching assistants configured for programming contexts have emerged as an appealing and scalable way to provide instant, equitable, round-the-clock support. Although digital TAs can provide a variety of help for programming tasks, from high-level problem solving advice to direct solution generation, the effectiveness of such tools depends on their ability to promote meaningful learning experiences. If students find the guardrails implemented in digital TAs too constraining, or if other expectations are not met, they may seek assistance in ways that do not help them learn. Thus, it is essential to identify the features that students believe make digital teaching assistants valuable. We deployed an LLM-powered digital assistant in an introductory programming course and collected student feedback (n=813) on the characteristics of the tool they perceived to be most important. Our results highlight that students value such tools for their ability to provide instant, engaging support, particularly during peak times such as before assessment deadlines. They also expressed a strong preference for features that enable them to retain autonomy in their learning journey, such as scaffolding that helps to guide them through problem-solving steps rather than simply being shown direct solutions.},

We surveyed all computer science majors in a small engineering-focused R1 university in order to: (1) capture a baseline assessment of how GenAI has been immediately adopted by aspiring computer scientists; (2) describe computing students' GenAI-related needs and concerns for their education and careers; and (3) discuss GenAI influences on CS pedagogy, curriculum, culture, and policy. We present an exploratory qualitative analysis of this data and discuss the impact of our findings on the emerging conversation around GenAI and education.},

abstract = {This work introduces design for a Generative AI (Gen-AI) based tutoring system customized for Egyptian community schools needs. Community schools are managed by NGOs as an alternative education to unprivileged students who missed the formal government education. Our research involved working with an Egyptian NGO and a community school in upper Egypt from March 2023 to September 2023. Several workshops were conducted with involved stakeholders and end users to collect the requirements for such a system. The proposed design reflects the views of management, teachers and student parents.It also adhere to Haman-Centered AI (HCAI) principles which prioritize human values and experiences. This paper lists the outcomes of this process and surveys potential tools that can be used in this system. The findings emphasize the need for Gen-AI to act as a teacher’s assistant rather than a replacement, it also highlights the need for localization as well as the need for an end-to-end solution rather than developing an isolated AI-based module. The proposed Gen-AI tutoring system integrates Generative AI, a Learning Management System (LMS), and comprehensive reporting dashboards. This design aims to meet the technical and pedagogical requirements of community school environments and produces a trusted tutoring system that empowers teachers and students.},

This study examines early user reactions to GenAI, consisting of 725 Reddit threads between 06/2022 and 05/2023. Through natural language processing (NLP) and content analysis, we observe an increasingly negative sentiment in the discussion and identify six main categories of student and faculty experiences of GenAI in education. These experiences reflect concerns about academic integrity and AI’s negative impact on the values of traditional education. Our analysis also highlights the tension and burden imposed by new technologies. Our findings suggest that dialogue between stakeholders in the education community is critical and can mitigate sources of tension between students and faculty.},

This paper explores the effects of exposure to AI-generated images on measures of design fixation and divergent thinking in a visual ideation task. Through a between-participants experiment (N=60), we found that support from an AI image generator during ideation leads to higher fixation on an initial example. Participants who used AI produced fewer ideas, with less variety and lower originality compared to a baseline. Our qualitative analysis suggests that the effectiveness of co-ideation with AI rests on participants’ chosen approach to prompt creation and on the strategies used by participants to generate ideas in response to the AI’s suggestions. We discuss opportunities for designing generative AI systems for ideation support and incorporating these AI tools into ideation workflows.},

As educators, we need to understand the potential and limitations of AI in HCI education and ensure our graduating HCI students are aware of the potential and limitations of AI in HCI. In this paper, we report on the main pedagogical insights gained from the inclusion of generative AI into a 10-week undergraduate module. We designed the module to encourage student experimentation with GAI models as part of the design brief requirement and planned practical sessions and discussions. Our insights are based on replies to a survey sent out to the students after completing the module. Our key findings, for HCI educators, report on the use of AI as a persona for developing project ideas and creating resources for design, and AI as a mirror for reflecting students’ understanding of key concepts and ideas and highlighting knowledge gaps. We also discuss potential pitfalls that should be considered and the need to assess students’ literacies and assumptions of GAIs as pedagogical tools. Finally, we put forward the case for educators to take the opportunities GAI presents as an educational tool and be experimental, creative, and courageous in their practice.

abstract = {Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and specifically generative AI (GenAI) are threatening to fundamentally reshape computing and society. Largely driven by large language models (LLMs), many tools are now able to interpret and generate both natural language instructions and source code. These capabilities have sparked urgent questions in the computing education community around how educators should adapt their pedagogy to address the challenges and to leverage the opportunities presented by this new technology. In this working group report, we undertake a comprehensive exploration of generative AI in the context of computing education and make five significant contributions. First, we provide a detailed review of the literature on LLMs in computing education and synthesise findings from 71 primary articles, nearly 80\% of which have been published in the first 8 months of 2023. Second, we report the findings of a survey of computing students and instructors from across 20 countries, capturing prevailing attitudes towards GenAI/LLMs and their use in computing education contexts. Third, to understand how pedagogy is already changing, we offer insights collected from in-depth interviews with 22 computing educators from five continents. Fourth, we use the ACM Code of Ethics to frame a discussion of ethical issues raised by the use of large language models in computing education, and we provide concrete advice for policy makers, educators, and students. Finally, we benchmark the performance of several current GenAI models/tools on various computing education datasets, and highlight the extent to which the capabilities of current models are rapidly improving.There is little doubt that LLMs and other forms of GenAI will have a profound impact on computing education over the coming years. However, just as the technology will continue to improve, so will our collective knowledge about how to leverage these new models and tools in educational settings. We expect many important conversations around this topic will emerge as the community explores how to provide more effective, inclusive, and personalised learning experiences. Our aim is that this report will serve as a focal point for both researchers and practitioners who are exploring, adapting, using, and evaluating GenAI and LLM-based tools in computing classrooms.},

abstract = {The recent emergence of LLM-based code generation models can potentially transform programming education. To pinpoint the current state of research on using LLM-based code generators to support the teaching and learning of programming, we conducted a systematic literature review of 21 papers published since 2018. The review focuses on (1) the teaching and learning practices in programming education that utilized LLM-based code generation models, (2) characteristics and (3) performance indicators of the models, and (4) aspects to consider when utilizing the models in programming education, including the risks and challenges. We found that the most commonly reported uses of LLM-based code generation models for teachers are generating assignments and evaluating student work, while for students, the models function as virtual tutors. We identified that the models exhibit accuracy limitations; generated content often contains minor errors that are manageable by instructors but pose risks for novice learners. Moreover, risks such as academic misconduct and over-reliance on the models are critical when considering integrating these models into education. Overall, LLM-based code generation models can be an assistive tool for both learners and instructors if the risks are mitigated.},

abstract = {While Large Language Models (LLMs) enable experienced programmers to increase their productivity, LLMs' impact on learning and productivity for novices is currently unclear. Recent work showed novice programmers struggle with prompting LLMs for code generation and suggested that the use of LLMs in CS education could exacerbate existing equity issues. Educators are now faced with the difficult question of whether and when to incorporate the use of LLMs into the CS curriculum without adversely impacting student learning and equity. To address these concerns, we study the effects of using an interactive LLM on code generation with novice programmers. We find that using our interactive LLM improves the accuracy of code generation over the baseline LLM. Additionally, after using the interactive LLM, novices write improved prompts even when using the baseline LLM. Based on our findings, we plan to create iGPTs, a set of customized, interactive LLMs spanning CS education learning goals as templates to facilitate LLM integration for improving student learning and retention.},

abstract = {The recent, widespread availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot may impact introductory programming courses (CS1) both in terms of what should be taught and how to teach it. Indeed, recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of solving the majority of the assignments and exams we previously used in CS1. In addition, professional software engineers are often using these tools, raising the question of whether we should be training our students in their use as well. This experience report describes a CS1 course at a large research-intensive university that fully embraces the use of LLMs from the beginning of the course. To incorporate the LLMs, the course was intentionally altered to reduce emphasis on syntax and writing code from scratch. Instead, the course now emphasizes skills needed to successfully produce software with an LLM. This includes explaining code, testing code, and decomposing large problems into small functions that are solvable by an LLM. In addition to frequent, formative assessments of these skills, students were given three large, open-ended projects in three separate domains (data science, image processing, and game design) that allowed them to showcase their creativity in topics of their choosing. In an end-of-term survey, students reported that they appreciated learning with the assistance of the LLM and that they interacted with the LLM in a variety of ways when writing code. We provide lessons learned for instructors who may wish to incorporate LLMs into their course.},

This paper explores the capabilities of LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude Sonnet) in solving complete, multi-part CS homework assignments from the SIGCSE Nifty Assignments list. Through qualitative and quantitative analysis, we found that LLM performance varied significantly across different assignments and models, with Claude Sonnet consistently outperforming the others. The presence of starter code and test cases improved performance for advanced LLMs, while certain assignments, particularly those involving visual elements, proved challenging for all models. LLMs often disregarded assignment requirements, produced subtly incorrect code, and struggled with context-specific tasks. Based on these findings, we propose strategies for designing LLM-resistant assignments.

abstract = {The launch of ChatGPT in November 2022 marked a seismic disruption to many disciplines and industries, including higher education. For the first time, students everywhere have widely available access to a Large Language Model (LLM) capable of generating content - including solutions to programming assignments in CS1 and CS2 - that can pass as the work of a high-achieving student while making traditional plagiarism-detection obsolete. This has spurred various responses in higher education, including a shift to more in-class and unplugged assessments. At the same time, LLMs are transforming the way that many people work, including professional software developers, and students similarly might be able to use them to enhance their learning. In this paper, we report on our experiences with a permissive policy towards the use of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence (AI) tools for assisting students with their programming assignments in CS1 and CS2 courses in the Spring 2023 semester. Students were allowed to use these tools however they wished as long as they submitted a form which included a transcript of their chat and a reflection on what they learned, if anything, through the interaction. We found that students largely approached the AI in positive ways and that they seemed to genuinely learn from the experience. We also document some things that did not go well and that remain challenges to using AI in programming courses, along with our recommendations on how these might be dealt with in the future.},

abstract = {Code reading and comprehension skills are essential for novices learning programming, and explain-in-plain-English tasks (EiPE) are a well-established approach for assessing these skills. However, manual grading of EiPE tasks is time-consuming and this has limited their use in practice. To address this, we explore an approach where students explain code samples to a large language model (LLM) which generates code based on their explanations. This generated code is then evaluated using test suites, and shown to students along with the test results. We are interested in understanding how automated formative feedback from an LLM guides students' subsequent prompts towards solving EiPE tasks. We analyzed 177 unique attempts on four EiPE exercises from 21 students, looking at what kinds of mistakes they made and how they fixed them. We found that when students made mistakes, they identified and corrected them using either a combination of the LLM-generated code and test case results, or they switched from describing the purpose of the code to describing the sample code line-by-line until the LLM-generated code exactly matched the obfuscated sample code. Our findings suggest both optimism and caution with the use of LLMs for unmonitored formative feedback. We identified false positive and negative cases, helpful variable naming, and clues of direct code recitation by students. For most students, this approach represents an efficient way to demonstrate and assess their code comprehension skills. However, we also found evidence of misconceptions being reinforced, suggesting the need for further work to identify and guide students more effectively.},

The case study brought up compelling insights. Students exhibited heightened engagement, and the lecturers transitioned from being traditional instructors teaching content to becoming mentors who guide students on what to do next, clarifying misunderstandings and addressing potential questions. Furthermore, students gained hands-on programming experience during the learning process, eliminating the traditional post-class experimentation phase.

abstract = {Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers numerous opportunities to revolutionise teaching and learning in Computing Education (CE). However, educators have expressed concerns that students may over-rely on GenAI and use these tools to generate solutions without engaging in the learning process. While substantial research has explored GenAI use in CE, and many Computer Science (CS) educators have expressed their opinions and suggestions on the subject, there remains little consensus on implementing curricula and assessment changes.In this paper, we describe our experiences with using GenAI in CS-focused educational settings and the changes we have implemented accordingly in our teaching in recent years since the popularisation of GenAI. From our experiences, we propose two primary actions for the CE community: 1) redesign take-home assignments to incorporate GenAI use and assess students on their process of using GenAI to solve a task rather than simply on the final product; 2) redefine the role of educators to emphasise metacognitive aspects of learning, such as critical thinking and self-evaluation. This paper presents and discusses these stances and outlines several practical methods to implement these strategies in CS classrooms. Then, we advocate for more research addressing the concrete impacts of GenAI on CE, especially those evaluating the validity and effectiveness of new teaching practices.},

abstract = {Self-regulation refers to the ability to plan, monitor, control and reflect on one's problem-solving process. Prior research has shown that self-regulated learning (SRL) strategies help improve novice performance in solving programming problems. However, with the advent of LLM tools like ChatGPT, novices can generate fairly accurate code by just providing the problem prompt, and hence may forego applying essential self-regulation strategies such as planning and reflection to solve the problem. In this position paper, we discuss challenges and opportunities that generative AI technologies pose for novices' self-regulation strategies in the context of programming problem solving. We believe that the key challenge facing educators is that such technologies may hamper novices' ability to regulate their programming problem solving process.On the other hand, these technologies also open up the possibility to design new interventions that promote better SRL strategies in learners. We draw on generic and domain-specific self-regulated learning theories as the basis of our work, and propose an SRL framework that incorporates use of generative AI tools in programming problem solving. We illustrate how the proposed framework guides exploration of the design space of interventions that integrate generative AI in CS education.},

abstract = {The integration of AI assistants, especially through the development of Large Language Models (LLMs), into computer science education has sparked significant debate, highlighting both their potential to augment student learning and the risks associated with their misuse. An emerging body of work has looked into using LLMs in education, primarily focusing on evaluating the performance of existing models or conducting short-term human subject studies. However, very little work has examined the impacts of LLM-powered assistants on students in entry-level programming courses, particularly in real-world contexts and over extended periods. To address this research gap, we conducted a semester-long, between-subjects study with 50 students using CodeTutor, an LLM-powered assistant developed by our research team. Our study results show that students who used CodeTutor (the "CodeTutor group" as the experimental group) achieved statistically significant improvements in their final scores compared to peers who did not use the tool (the "control group"). Within the CodeTutor group, those without prior experience with LLM-powered tools demonstrated significantly greater performance gain than their counterparts. We also found that students expressed positive feedback regarding CodeTutor's capability to comprehend their queries and assist in learning programming language syntax. However, they had concerns about CodeTutor's limited role in developing critical thinking skills. Over the course of the semester, students' agreement with CodeTutor's suggestions decreased, with a growing preference for support from traditional human teaching assistants. Our findings also show that students turned to CodeTutor for different tasks, including programming task completion, syntax comprehension, and debugging, particularly seeking help for programming assignments. Our analysis further reveals that the quality of user prompts was significantly correlated with CodeTutor's response effectiveness. Building upon these results, we discuss the implications of our findings for the need to integrate Generative AI literacy into curricula to foster critical thinking skills, and turn to examining the temporal dynamics of user engagement with LLM-powered tools. We further discuss the discrepancy between the anticipated functions of tools and students' actual capabilities, which sheds light on the need for tailored strategies to improve educational outcomes.},

abstract = {As the prominence of Large Language Models (LLMs) grows in various sectors, their potential in education warrants exploration. In this study, we investigate the feasibility of employing GPT-3.5 from OpenAI, as an LLM teaching assistant (TA) or a virtual TA in computer science (CS) courses. The objective is to enhance the accessibility of CS education while maintaining academic integrity by refraining from providing direct solutions to current-semester assignments. Targeting Foundations of Programming (COMP202), an undergraduate course that introduces students to programming with Python, we have developed a virtual TA using the LangChain framework, known for integrating language models with diverse data sources and environments. The virtual TA assists students with their code and clarifies complex concepts. For homework questions, it is designed to guide students with hints rather than giving out direct solutions. We assessed its performance first through a qualitative evaluation, then a survey-based comparative analysis, using a mix of questions commonly asked on the COMP202 discussion board and questions created by the authors. Our preliminary results indicate that the virtual TA outperforms human TAs on clarity and engagement, matching them on accuracy when the question is non-assignment-specific, for which human TAs still proved more reliable. These findings suggest that while virtual TAs, leveraging the capabilities of LLMs, hold great promise towards making CS education experience more accessible and engaging, their optimal use necessitates human supervision. We conclude by identifying several directions that could be explored in future implementations.},

abstract = {The viral launch of new generative AI (GAI) systems, such as ChatGPT and Text-to-Image (TTL) generators, sparked questions about how they can be effectively incorporated into writing education. However, it is still unclear how teachers, parents, and students perceive and suspect GAI systems in elementary school settings. We conducted a workshop with twelve families (parent-child dyads) with children ages 8-12 and interviewed sixteen teachers in order to understand each stakeholder’s perspectives and opinions on GAI systems for learning and teaching writing. We found that the GAI systems could be beneficial in generating adaptable teaching materials for teachers, enhancing ideation, and providing students with personalized, timely feedback. However, there are concerns over authorship, students’ agency in learning, and uncertainty concerning bias and misinformation. In this article, we discuss design strategies to mitigate these constraints by implementing an adults-oversight system, balancing AI-role allocation, and facilitating customization to enhance students’ agency over writing projects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT. The pace of advancement of large language models (LLMs) motivates the use of existing infrastructure to automate the evaluation of LLM performance on computing education tasks. Concept inventories are well suited for evaluation because of their careful design and prior validity evidence. OBJECTIVES. Our research explores the feasibility of using an automated benchmarking framework to evaluate computer science (CS) concept inventories. We explore three primary objectives: evaluation of LLM performance on the SCS1 and BDSI concept inventories; informal expert panel review of items which had variations between LLM and expected student performance; and description of challenges with using benchmarking infrastructure as a methodological innovation. METHOD. We used the Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) framework to evaluate the SCS1 and BDSI against 10 LLMS with zero-shot and few-shot in-context learning: GPT (3.5, 4.0), Claude (1.3, 2.0, 2.1), Llama (7B, 13B, 70B), Mistral v0.1 7B, and Mixtral 8x7B. We used psychometric data from prior studies to measure knowledge levels for each LLM run. We then conducted an informal expert review to qualitatively explore how question design, CS content knowledge, and LLM design may explain differences between LLM and expected student performances. FINDINGS. Our quantitative analysis found that most LLM response patterns reflected a below average introductory computing student with the SCS1 and did not fit the psychometric 2PL model for the BDSI. Our qualitative analysis identified that LLMs performed well on code infill questions, but poorly on nested conditionals, runtime analysis, and longer questions. We also identified several methodological challenges related to item security, translation, the structure when using HELM. IMPLICATIONS. We consider the feasibility of using automated benchmarking as a methodology to support more reproducible, replicable, and rigorous investigations to understand the intersection of LLM capabilities, computing concepts, and assessment design. We also consider connections between psychometric approaches and LLM evaluations to inform the design of computing assessments that are more resilient to LLM advancements.},

abstract = {ChatGPT is a conversational AI platform that can produce code to solve problems when provided with a natural language prompt. Prior work on similar AI models has shown that they perform well on typical intro-level Computer Science problems. However, little is known about the performance of such tools on Data Science (DS) problems. In this work, we assess the performance of ChatGPT on assignments from three DS courses with varying difficulty levels. First, we apply the raw assignment prompts provided to the students and find that ChatGPT performs well on assignments with dataset(s) descriptions and progressive question prompts, which divide the programming requirements into sub-problems. Then, we perform prompt engineering on the assignments for which ChatGPT had low performance. We find that the following prompt engineering techniques significantly increased ChatGPT's performance: breaking down abstract questions into steps, breaking down steps into multiple prompts, providing descriptions of the dataset(s), including algorithmic details, adding specific instructions to entice specific actions, and removing extraneous information. Finally, we discuss how our findings suggest potential changes to curriculum design of DS courses.},

These systems offer exciting capabilities for CS Education (CSEd), such as generating programs, that students can well utilize for their learning. Among the many dimensions that might affect the effective adoption of GenAI for CSEd, in this paper, we investigate students' trust. Trust in GenAI influences the extent to which students adopt GenAI, in turn affecting their learning. In this paper, we present results from a survey of 253 students at two large universities to understand how much they trust GenAI tools and their feedback on how GenAI impacts their performance in CS courses. Our results show that students have different levels of trust in GenAI. We also observe different levels of confidence and motivation, highlighting the need for further understanding of factors impacting trust.},

While some advocate to ban the tools entirely, others suggest embracing them so that students develop the skills for utilizing the tools safely and responsibly. Studies indicate positive impacts, as well as cautions, on student outcomes when these tools are integrated into courses. We studied the impact of incorporating instruction on industry-standard generative AI tools into a mid-level software development course with students from 16 Minority Serving Institutions. 89\% of student participants used generative AI tools prior to the course without any formal instruction. After formal instruction, students most frequently used generative AI tools for explaining concepts and learning new things. Students generally reported positive viewpoints on their ability to learn to program and learn problem-solving skills while using generative AI tools. Finally, we found that students: reported to understand their code when they work with generative AI tools, are critical about the outputs that generative AI tools provide, and check outputs of generative AI tools to ensure accuracy.},

We detail four different experiments, with a total of 119 students, where we refine our system, compare it to human-facilitated LBT experiences, and deploy it in two, month-long in-the-wild environments. We find that our system is able to successfully convey a learner persona similar to a human pretending to be novice while also providing comparable LBT benefits. These benefits include helping students identify areas for improvement, develop a more accurate assessment of their own abilities, and improve their overall attitudes toward computer science. We also explore how students choose to adopt our system into their study habits while situated in real university courses.},

abstract = {There is both great hope and concern about the future of Computer Science practice and education concerning the recent advent of large language models (LLMs).We present the first study to extensively evaluate the ability of such a model to solve problems in Computer Science Theory. Specifically, we tested 165 exam-level problems across 16 specific topics related to computer science theory, ranging from preliminary data structures to algorithm design paradigms to theory of computation (automata and complexity). Our results use the recent popular models (GPT-4 and GPT-4o). This is a rapidly evolving field, with model performance continuously improving. We present our results primarily as an indication of what they can already achieve-equivalently how they can already be useful-today, fully expecting them to improve even further in the near future. Our results show that what was very recently a state-of-the-art model (GPT-4) can solve 77\% of free-response problems in data structures and algorithms with little to no guidance. The latest model, GPT-4o, can solve around 46\% of the Theory of Computation problems we posed, with predictable categories for which problems it could not solve. When broken down by topic, the model can solve 80\% of problems in 4 out of the 15 topics and at least half in 8 other topics. Other problems, namely more visual problems, either require more substantial coaching or seem to still be beyond the capabilities of the language model--for now. By understanding the strengths and limitations of these models for solving theory problems, we can open the door to future work, ranging from human educational assessment on the topic to automated tutors for learners of the subject.},

abstract = {Background: ChatGPT became widespread in early 2023 and enabled the broader public to use powerful generative AI, creating a new means for students to complete course assessments.  Purpose: In this paper, we explored the degree to which generative AI impacted the frequency and nature of cheating in a large introductory programming course. We also estimate the learning impact of students choosing to submit plagiarized work rather than their own work.  Methods: We identified a collection of markers that we believe are indicative of plagiarism in this course. We compare the estimated prevalence of cheating in the semesters before and during which ChatGPT became widely available. We use linear regression to estimate the impact of students' patterns of cheating on their final exam performance. Findings: The patterns associated with these plagiarism markers suggest that the quantity of plagiarism increased with the advent of generative AI, and we see evidence of a shift from online plagiarism hubs (e.g., Chegg, CourseHero) to ChatGPT. In addition, we observe statistically significant learning losses proportional to the amount of presumed plagiarism, but there is no statistical difference on the proportionality between semesters.  Implications: Our findings suggest that unproctored exams become increasingly insecure and care needs to be taken to ensure the validity of summative assessments. More importantly, our results suggest that generative AI can be detrimental to students' learning. It seems necessary for educators to reduce the benefit of students using generative AI for counterproductive purposes.},

abstract = {Problem decomposition is an important skill in programming, allowing learners to break down complex tasks into manageable subgoals. However, translating these subgoals into executable code poses a significant challenge for novice programmers. In this study conducted in an introductory programming course, learners received instruction in stepwise refinement and integration of AI-generated code within their assignments. Throughout the course, learners were permitted to rely on AI code generators, following opportunities to receive feedback on their ability to read and write code without AI assistance.  Our findings show that learners frequently relied on AI-generated code when working on assignments outside the classroom, but that the frequency of reliance varied from one assignment to another. The reliance on AI-generated code was not correlated with the learners' year in their degree, nor whether they were enrolled in a CS degree or not. Instead, it was associated with their prior knowledge, as learners who were less proficient in reading and writing code were more likely to seek AI assistance.  AI tools were primarily used to translate subgoals into code, fix errors, and explain algorithmic concepts. Few learners encountered difficulties in understanding or integrating AI generated code into their solutions. Overall, learner performance in meeting assignment requirements was relatively high, regardless of their prior knowledge or reliance on AI code generators. We conclude that leveraging the capabilities of generative AI can effectively bridge the gap between problem-solving and implementation, enabling learners to engage in skills that might otherwise be beyond their reach.},

abstract = {In the rapidly evolving Generative AI (GenAI) landscape, source code and natural language are being mixed and used in new ways. This presents opportunities for rethinking teaching practice in Introductory Programming (CS1) courses that includes, but goes beyond, assessment. In this paper we examine the reasons why and how instructors who are early adopters of GenAI are using it in their teaching, and why others are not. We also explore the changes and adaptations that are currently being made to practice. This is achieved by synthesizing insights from several recent studies that have collected primary data from introductory programming instructors who are teaching with, considering teaching with, or actively not teaching with GenAI.Due to the fast pace of GenAI development and adoption, the fixed-pace and cyclical nature of education, and the relatively slow pace of research (including ethical approvals) and publication cycles, research with primary data from instructors is only being published relatively recently. In computing education, there is not yet enough published research with primary data from CS1 instructors to warrant a systematic literature review, although in the next year this will likely be possible. Based on an analysis of the nascent research that has been published, we propose emerging and flexible guidelines on how CS1 instructors could adapt their practice based on what others have done so far. These guidelines highlight important factors to consider when integrating GenAI in CS1 courses, which for many is only beginning.},

LBT with teachable agents helps learners identify knowledge gaps and discover new knowledge. However, teachable agents require expensive programming of subject-specific knowledge. While LLMs as teachable agents can reduce the cost, LLMs’ expansive knowledge as tutees discourages learners from teaching. We propose a prompting pipeline that restrains LLMs’ knowledge and makes them initiate “why” and “how” questions for effective knowledge-building. We combined these techniques into TeachYou, an LBT environment for algorithm learning, and AlgoBo, an LLM-based tutee chatbot that can simulate misconceptions and unawareness prescribed in its knowledge state. Our technical evaluation confirmed that our prompting pipeline can effectively configure AlgoBo’s problem-solving performance. Through a between-subject study with 40 algorithm novices, we also observed that AlgoBo’s questions led to knowledge-dense conversations (effect size=0.71). Lastly, we discuss design implications, cost-efficiency, and personalization of LLM-based teachable agents.},

abstract = {Though the increased availability of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant potential for change in the way students learn to program, the text-based nature of the available tools currently preclude block-based languages from much of that innovation. In an attempt to remedy this, we identify the strengths and weaknesses of using a transpiler to leverage the existing learning in commercially available LLMs and Scratch, a visual block-based programming language.Using only prompt engineering, we evaluate an LLM's performance on two common classroom tasks in a Scratch curriculum. We evaluate the LLM's ability to: 1) Create project solutions that compile and satisfy project requirements and 2) Analyze student projects' completion of project requirements using natural language. In both cases, we find results indicating that prompt-engineering alone is insufficient to reliably produce high-quality results. For projects of medium complexity, the LLM-generated solutions consistently failed to follow correct syntax or, in the few instances with correct syntax, produce correct solutions. When used for auto-grading, we found a correlation between scores assigned by the official Scratch Encore autograder and those generated by the LLM, nevertheless the discrepancies between the 'real' scores and the scores assigned by the LLM remained too great for the tool to be reliable in a classroom setting.},

abstract = {Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for personalized learning and support is becoming a promising tool in computing education. AI Assistants can help students with programming, problem-solving, converse with them to clarify course content, explain error messages to help with debugging, and much more. However, using cloud-based LLMs poses risks around data security, privacy, but also control of the overarching system.To address these concerns, we created a locally-stored Small Language Model (SLM) that leverages different Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to support computing students' learning. We compare one SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 - fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1) against two popular LLMs (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4-32k) to see the viability for computing educators to use in their course(s).We use conversations from a CS1 course (N = 1,260), providing students with an AI Assistant (using gpt-3.5-turbo) to help them learn content and support problem-solving while completing their Python programming assignment. In total, we had 269 students use the AI Assistant, with a total of 1,988 questions asked. Using this real conversational data, we re-ran student questions using our novel SLM (neural-chat-7b-v3 testing nine different RAG methods) and gpt-4-32k, then compared those results against the original gpt-3.5-turbo responses. Our findings indicate that using an SLM with RAG can perform similarly, if not better, than LLMs. This shows that it is possible for computing educators to use SLMs (with RAG) in their course(s) as a tool for scalable learning, supporting content understanding and problem-solving needs, while employing their own policies on data privacy and security.},

abstract = {Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence are poised to reshape introductory programming education, challenging conventional teaching methodologies. This paper presents a scoping review that explores the current understanding of integrating generative artificial intelligence tools in the learning of introductory programming. Through an analysis of 28 selected studies, this review provides a snapshot of the landscape in mid-2024, presenting benefits, concerns, and recommendations surrounding the use of generative artificial intelligence within programming education. It finds insufficient guidance on how to implement recommended pedagogical strategies, limited consideration of student perceptions and experiences, and a predominance of short study time frames. Additionally, there is a significant research gap in second-level education, particularly in the United Kingdom and Ireland. The paper discusses how these gaps signal a need for more human-centered approaches in the current research. The paper concludes with recommendations for future research, aiming to inspire further inquiry and advance the understanding of generative artificial intelligence’s role in programming education from a human-centered perspective.},

abstract = {Programming skills are typically developed through completing various hands-on exercises. Such programming problems can be contextualized to students’ interests and cultural backgrounds. Prior research in educational psychology has demonstrated that context personalization of exercises stimulates learners’ situational interests and positively affects their engagement. However, creating a varied and comprehensive set of programming exercises for students to practice on is a time-consuming and laborious task for computer science educators. Previous studies have shown that large language models can generate conceptually and contextually relevant programming exercises. Thus, they offer a possibility to automatically produce personalized programming problems to fit students’ interests and needs. This article reports on a user study conducted in an elective introductory programming course that included contextually personalized programming exercises created with GPT-4. The quality of the exercises was evaluated by both the students and the authors. Additionally, this work investigated student attitudes towards the created exercises and their engagement with the system. The results demonstrate that the quality of exercises generated with GPT-4 was generally high. What is more, the course participants found them engaging and useful. This suggests that AI-generated programming problems can be a worthwhile addition to introductory programming courses, as they provide students with a practically unlimited pool of practice material tailored to their personal interests and educational needs.},

abstract = {In a typical introductory programming course, grading student-submitted programs involves an autograder which compiles and runs the programs and tests their functionality with predefined test cases, with no attention to the source code. However, in an educational setting, grading based on inspection of the source code is required for two main reasons (1) awarding partial marks to 'partially correct' code that may be failing the testcase check (2) awarding marks (or penalties) based on source code quality or specific criteria that the instructor may have laid out in the problem statement (e.g. 'implement sorting using bubble-sort'). However, grading based on studying the source code can be highly time consuming when the course has a large enrollment. In this paper we present the design and evaluation of an AI Assistant for source code grading, which we have named TA Buddy. TA Buddy is powered by Code Llama, a large language model especially trained for code related tasks, which we fine-tuned using a graded programs dataset. Given a problem statement, student code submissions and a grading rubric, TA Buddy can be asked to generate suggested grades, i.e. ratings for the various rubric criteria, for each submission. The human teaching assistant (TA) can then accept or overrule these grades. We evaluated the TA Buddy-assisted manual grading against 'pure' manual grading and found that the time taken to grade reduced by 24\% while maintaining grade agreement in the two cases at 90\%.},

While there is a growing body of research in computing education on utilizing large language models&nbsp;(LLMs) in generation and engagement with coding exercises, the use of LLMs for generating programming MCQs has not been extensively explored. We analyzed the capability of GPT-4 to produce multiple-choice questions (MCQs) aligned with specific learning objectives (LOs) from Python programming classes in higher education. Specifically, we developed an LLM-powered (GPT-4) system for generation of MCQs from high-level course context and module-level LOs. We evaluated 651 LLM-generated and 449 human-crafted MCQs aligned to 246 LOs from 6 Python courses. We found that GPT-4 was capable of producing MCQs with clear language, a single correct choice, and high-quality distractors. We also observed that the generated MCQs appeared to be well-aligned with the LOs. Our findings can be leveraged by educators wishing to take advantage of the state-of-the-art generative models to support MCQ authoring efforts.},

To help with this, a good analogy can bridge the gap between unfamiliar concepts and familiar ones, providing an engaging way to aid understanding. However, creating effective educational analogies is difficult even for experienced instructors. We investigate to what extent large language models (LLMs), specifically ChatGPT, can provide access to personally relevant analogies on demand. Focusing on recursion, a challenging threshold concept, we conducted an investigation analyzing the analogies generated by more than 350 first-year computing students. They were provided with a code snippet and tasked to generate their own recursion-based analogies using ChatGPT, optionally including personally relevant topics in their prompts. We observed a great deal of diversity in the analogies produced with student-prescribed topics, in contrast to the otherwise generic analogies, highlighting the value of student creativity when working with LLMs. Not only did students enjoy the activity and report an improved understanding of recursion, but they described more easily remembering analogies that were personally and culturally relevant.},

abstract = {Recent studies have showcased the exceptional performance of LLMs (Large Language Models) on assessment questions across various discipline areas. This can be helpful if used to support the learning process, for example by enabling students to quickly generate and contrast alternative solution approaches. However, concerns about student over-reliance and inappropriate use of LLMs in education are common. Understanding the capabilities of LLMs is essential for instructors to make informed decisions on question choices for learning and assessment tasks. In CS (Computer Science), previous evaluations of LLMs have focused on CS1 and CS2 questions, and little is known about how well LLMs perform for assessment questions in upper-level CS courses such as CG (Computer Graphics), which covers a wide variety of concepts and question types. To address this gap, we compiled a dataset of past assessment questions used in a final-year undergraduate course about introductory CG, and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 on this dataset. We also classified assessment questions and evaluated the performance of GPT-4 for different types of questions. We found that the performance tended to be best for simple mathematical questions, and worst for questions requiring creative thinking, and those with complex descriptions and/or images. We share our benchmark dataset with the community and provide new insights into the capabilities of GPT-4 in the context of CG courses. We highlight opportunities for teaching staff to improve student learning by guiding the use of LLMs for CG questions, and inform decisions around question choices for assessment tasks.},

abstract = {While many recent studies have explored how large language models can transform computer science instruction from the instructor perspective, they are primarily at the college level. Thus, little is known about using large language models towards curriculum development and teacher supports outside of the college setting. Given the emphasis placed on culturally responsive teaching at the K-8 level and well-documented evidence of insensitive and inaccurate language model outputs from a cultural perspective, it is imperative to perform systematic and principled research before considering their use in this setting.This paper explores the potential of teachers using large language models to brainstorm instructional Scratch projects. Specifically, we use GPT-3 to mimic structured projects from an existing computer science curriculum but situate the generated projects in different contexts/themes. We qualitatively analyze 300 project ideas generated by GPT and find 81\% of the generated ideas satisfy our metrics for technical alignment and theme quality. We identify two major weaknesses: code complexity of generated projects and presence of potential insensitive elements that would require human filtering. We conclude that, while not ready as a student-facing solution, teachers could use GPT to effectively brainstorm customized instructional materials.},

abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence tools (Generative AI), such as ChatGPT, allow users to interact with them in intuitive ways (e.g., conversational) and receive (mostly) good-quality answers. In education, such systems can support students’ learning objectives by providing accessible explanations and examples even when students pose vague queries. But, they also encourage undesired help-seeking behaviors, such as by providing solutions to the students’ homework. Therefore, it is important to better understand how students approach such tools and the potential issues such approaches might present for the learners.In this paper, we present a case study for understanding student-AI collaboration to solve programming tasks in the CS1 introductory programming course. To this end, we recruited a gender-balanced majority non-white set of 15 CS1 students at the University of Houston, a large public university in the US. We observed them solving programming tasks. We used a mixed-method approach to study their interactions as they tackled Python programming tasks, focusing on when and why they used ChatGPT for problem-solving. We analyze and classify the questions submitted by the 15 participants to ChatGPT. Additionally, we analyzed user interaction patterns, their reactions to ChatGPT’s responses, and the potential impacts of Generative AI on their perception of self-efficacy.Our results suggest that, in about a third of the cases, the student attempted to complete the task by submitting the full description of the tasks to ChatGPT without making any effort on their own. We also observed that few students verified their solutions. We discuss the potential implications of these results.},

We developed CodeAid, an LLM-powered programming assistant delivering helpful, technically correct responses, without revealing code solutions. CodeAid answers conceptual questions, generates pseudo-code with line-by-line explanations, and annotates student’s incorrect code with fix suggestions. We deployed CodeAid in a programming class of 700 students for a 12-week semester. A thematic analysis of 8,000 usages of CodeAid was performed, further enriched by weekly surveys, and 22 student interviews. We then interviewed eight programming educators to gain further insights. Our findings reveal four design considerations for future educational AI assistants: D1) exploiting AI’s unique benefits; D2) simplifying query formulation while promoting cognitive engagement; D3) avoiding direct responses while encouraging motivated learning; and D4) maintaining transparency and control for students to asses and steer AI responses.},

Previous research has evaluated these LLMs for various applications such as generating programming exercises and solutions. However, these evaluations have predominantly been conducted by instructors and researchers, not considering the actual usage of LLMs by students. This study adopts a student-first approach to comprehensively understand how undergraduate computer science students utilize ChatGPT, a popular LLM, released by OpenAI. We employ a combination of student surveys and interviews to obtain valuable insights into the benefits, challenges, and suggested improvements related to ChatGPT. Our findings suggest that a majority of students (over 57\%) have a convincingly positive outlook towards adopting ChatGPT as an aid in coursework-related tasks. However, our research also highlights various challenges that must be resolved for long-term acceptance of ChatGPT amongst students. The findings from this investigation have broader implications and may be applicable to other LLMs and their role in computing education.},

abstract = {Generative AI, notably ChatGPT, has garnered attention in computer science education. This paper presents a controlled experiment that explores ChatGPT's role in CS1 in a classroom setting. Specifically, we aim to investigate the impact of ChatGPT on student learning outcomes and their behaviors when working on programming assignments. Participants were tasked with creating a UML diagram and subsequently implementing its design through programming, followed by a closed-book post-evaluation and a post-survey. All the participants were required to screen-record the whole process. In total, 56 participants were recruited, with 48 successful screen recordings. Participants in the Experimental Group can access ChatGPT 3.5 and other online resources, such as Google and Stack Overflow when creating the UML diagram and programming; however, participants in the Control Group can access all online resources except for ChatGPT (i.e., the only design variable is the access to ChatGPT). Finally, we measured and analyzed participants' learning outcomes through their UML diagram, programming, and post-evaluation scores. We also analyzed the time participants took to complete the tasks and their interactions with ChatGPT and other resources from the screen recordings. After finishing the tasks, student participants also provided their perceptions of using ChatGPT in CS1 through a post-survey.With rigorous quantitative and qualitative analysis, we found that (1) using ChatGPT does not present a significant impact on students' learning performance in the CS1 assignment-style tasks; (2) once using ChatGPT, students' tendency to explore other traditional educational resources is largely reduced (though available) and they tend to rely solely on ChatGPT, and this reliance on ChatGPT did not guarantee enhanced learning performance; (3) the majority of students hold neutral views on ChatGPT's role in CS1 programming but most of them raised concerns about its potential ethical issues and inconsistent performance across different tasks. We hope this study can help educators and students better understand the impact of ChatGPT in CS1 and inspire future work to provide proper guidelines for using ChatGPT in introductory programming classes.},

The recent proliferation of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, offers students a new source of help that is always available on-demand. However, it is unclear how this new resource compares to existing help-seeking resources along dimensions of perceived quality, latency, and trustworthiness. In this paper, we investigate the help-seeking preferences and experiences of computing students now that generative AI tools are available to them. We collected survey data (n=47) and conducted interviews (n=8) with computing students. Our results suggest that although these models are being rapidly adopted, they have not yet fully eclipsed traditional help resources. The help-seeking resources that students rely on continue to vary depending on the task and other factors. Finally, we observed preliminary evidence about how help-seeking with generative AI is a skill that needs to be developed, with disproportionate benefits for those who are better able to harness the capabilities of LLMs. We discuss potential implications for integrating generative AI into computing classrooms and the future of help-seeking in the era of generative AI.},

abstract = {This paper explores how Generative AI (GenAI) can be introduced within summative assessment components in software engineering education. We present an example of an assessment which allows learners to use GenAI in a freeform, constructionist manner, as part of a large, software development project. This work is inspired by previously executed AI-focused assessments and surveys, which explicitly indicate that learners on an Applied Software Engineering Degree Apprenticeship Programme want to formally learn how to use GenAI tools when programming and their employers want to see these skills from graduates. The learning outcome of the assignment was for learners to explore a typical developmental pipeline as a solo developer, moving from design to development to finished product. Learners were marked exclusively on their end product and understanding of application components, not the written code itself, resulting in an assessment where the end product and project were prioritised over foundational code (which was adequately assessed in other components). The results show that all learners used GenAI to some extent during their project, and in all cases, they found it beneficial for large programming tasks. Learners were generally able to produce a larger, more comprehensive and more ambitious project, compared to previous years. It is proposed that removing the barrier to GenAI - and demystifying it - can encourage a constructionist approach to its use, and normalise it as a potential tool for programming.},

abstract = {Despite recognizing that Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate inaccurate or unacceptable responses, universities are increasingly making such models available to their students. Existing university policies defer the responsibility of checking for correctness and appropriateness of LLM responses to students and assume that they will have the required knowledge and skills to do so on their own. In this work, we conducted a series of user studies with students (N=47) from a large North American public research university to understand if and how they critically engage with LLMs. Our participants evaluated an LLM provided by the university in a quasi-experimental setup; first by themselves, and then with a scaffolded design probe that guided them through an end-user auditing exercise. Qualitative analysis of participant think-aloud and LLM interaction data showed that students without basic AI literacy skills struggle to conceptualize and evaluate LLM biases on their own. However, they transition to focused thinking and purposeful interactions when provided with structured guidance. We highlight areas where current university policies may fall short and offer policy and design recommendations to better support students.},

abstract = {In 2023, we developed and deployed AI-based tools in CS50 at Harvard University to provide students with 24/7 interactive assistance, approximating a 1:1 teacher-to-student ratio. These tools offer code explanations, style suggestions, and responses to course-related inquiries, emulating human educators to foster critical thinking. However, maintaining alignment with instructional goals is challenging, especially with frequent updates to the underlying large language models (LLMs). We thus propose a continuous improvement process for LLM-based systems using a collaborative human-in-the-loop approach. We introduce a systematic evaluation framework for assessing and refining the performance of AI-based tutors, combining human-graded and model-graded evaluations. Using few-shot prompting and fine-tuning, we aim to ensure our AI tools adopt pedagogically sound teaching styles. Fine-tuning with a small, high-quality dataset has shown significant improvements in aligning with teaching goals, as confirmed through multi-turn conversation evaluations. Additionally, our framework includes a model-evaluation backend that teaching assistants periodically review, ensuring the AI system remains effective and aligned with instructional objectives. This paper offers insights into our methods and the impact of these AI tools on CS50 and contributes to the discourse on AI in education, showcasing scalable, personalized learning enhancements.},

abstract = {Students in introductory Computer Science (CS) courses sometimes struggle with learning course content, but feel these struggles are uniquely theirs. To foster a more inclusive CS culture and normalize challenges in the learning process, we designed a conversational agent (“chatbot”) that self-discloses information about the chatbot’s own imaginary struggles with learning course material. Inspired by previous work in the mental health domain where humans reciprocated disclosure when a chatbot disclosed sensitive information, our goal was to promote student self-disclosure of learning challenges and to help students feel less alone. To inform design, we first conducted three focus groups with CS students on themes of identity and belonging. Based on these findings, we designed a self-disclosing chatbot (“Mibi”) and deployed it in a pilot summer course (40 students) and a larger course (460 students) in the fall semester of 2023. Our work is the first real-world deployment of a chatbot in higher education for promoting student wellbeing, rather than assisting with practical course content. We highlight findings from this exploratory study, sharing how students engaged with Mibi, where it succeeded, where it has room to grow, and how that can inform future iterations of this promising new classroom companion for student mental health.},

abstract = {The capability of large language models (LLMs) to generate, debug, and explain code has sparked the interest of researchers and educators in undergraduate programming, with many anticipating their transformative potential in programming education. However, decisions about why and how to use LLMs in programming education may involve more than just the assessment of an LLM’s technical capabilities. Using the social shaping of technology theory as a guiding framework, our study explores how students’ social perceptions influence their own LLM usage. We then examine the correlation of self-reported LLM usage with students’ self-efficacy and midterm performances in an undergraduate programming course. Triangulating data from an anonymous end-of-course student survey (n = 158), a mid-course self-efficacy survey (n=158), student interviews (n = 10), self-reported LLM usage on homework, and midterm performances, we discovered that students’ use of LLMs was associated with their expectations for their future careers and their perceptions of peer usage. Additionally, early self-reported LLM usage in our context correlated with lower self-efficacy and lower midterm scores, while students’ perceived over-reliance on LLMs, rather than their usage itself, correlated with decreased self-efficacy later in the course.},

abstract = {Courses in computer science (CS) often assess student programming assignments manually, with the intent of providing in-depth feedback to each student regarding correctness, style, efficiency, and other quality attributes. As class sizes increase, however, it is hard to provide detailed feedback consistently, especially when multiple assessors are required to handle a larger number of assignment submissions. Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer a promising alternative to help automate this process in a consistent, scalable, and minimally-biased manner.This paper explores ChatGPT-4's scalablility and accuracy in assessing programming assignments based on predefined rubrics in the context of a case study we conducted in an upper-level undergraduate and graduate CS course at Vanderbilt University. In this case study, we employed a method that compared assessments generated by ChatGPT-4 against human graders to measure the accuracy, precision, and recall associated with identifying programming mistakes. Our results show that when ChatGPT-4 is used properly (e.g., with appropriate prompt engineering and feature selection) it can improve objectivity and grading efficiency, thereby acting as a complementary tool to human graders for advanced computer science graduate and undergraduate students.},

abstract = {External help resources are frequently used by novice programmers solving classwork in undergraduate computing courses. Traditionally, these tools consisted of web resources such as tutorial websites and Q&amp;A forums. With the rise of Generative AI (GenAI), there has been increasing concern and research about how external resources should be used in the classroom. However, little work has directly contrasted student beliefs and perceptions of web resources with GenAI, has grounded these beliefs in prior psychological theory, and has investigated how demographic factors and student backgrounds influence these beliefs and intentions. We administered a vignette-style survey across two courses required for a CS major at an R1 University, a freshman (n = 152) and senior capstone course (n = 44). Students responded to likert questions aiming to measure behavioral factors related to these tools, such as intention to use, perceived attitudes, peer perceptions, and their own perceived tool competency. We primarily investigate the results of an introductory course, finding that novices have a wide range of opinions on both resources, but overall find them slightly useful and have a tendency to prefer web-search. We compare this with seniors, who have more positive perceptions of these tools, and discuss possible reasons and implications for this difference. We constructed two path models to investigate which factors strongly influence novices’ intention to use resources and find the primary factor to be their general attitudes in how these tools will result in a positive or negative outcome (e.g. perceived benefits, justifiability). We also measure the effects of student background on intention to use these resources. Finally, we discuss implications and suggestions on how instructors can use this information to approach, address, and influence resource usage in their classrooms.},

abstract = {Learning to program can be challenging, and providing high-quality and timely support at scale is hard. Generative AI and its products, like ChatGPT, can create a solution for most intro-level programming problems. However, students might use these tools to just generate code for them, resulting in reduced engagement and limited learning. In this paper, we present CodeTailor, a system that leverages a large language model (LLM) to provide personalized help to students while still encouraging cognitive engagement. CodeTailor provides a personalized Parsons puzzle to support struggling students. In a Parsons puzzle, students place mixed-up code blocks in the correct order to solve a problem. A technical evaluation with previous incorrect student code snippets demonstrated that CodeTailor could deliver high-quality (correct, personalized, and concise) Parsons puzzles based on their incorrect code. We conducted a within-subjects study with 18 novice programmers. Participants perceived CodeTailor as more engaging than just receiving an LLM-generated solution (the baseline condition). In addition, participants applied more supported elements from the scaffolded practice to the posttest when using CodeTailor than baseline. Overall, most participants preferred using CodeTailor versus just receiving the LLM-generated code for learning. Qualitative observations and interviews also provided evidence for the benefits of CodeTailor, including thinking more about solution construction, fostering continuity in learning, promoting reflection, and boosting confidence. We suggest future design ideas to facilitate active learning opportunities with generative AI techniques.},

abstract = {We explored how undergraduate introductory programming students naturalistically used generative AI to solve programming problems. We focused on the relationship between their use of AI to their self-regulation strategies, self-efficacy, and fear of failure in programming. In this repeated-measures, mixed-methods research, we examined students' patterns of using generative AI with qualitative student reflections and their self-regulation, self-efficacy, and fear of failure with quantitative instruments at multiple times throughout the semester. We also explored the relationships among these variables to learner characteristics, perceived usefulness of AI, and performance. Overall, our results suggest that student factors affect their baseline use of AI. In particular, students with higher self-efficacy, lower fear of failure, or higher prior grades tended to use AI less or later in the problem-solving process and rated it as less useful than others. Interestingly, we found no relationship between students' self-regulation strategies and their use of AI. Students who used AI less or later in problem-solving also had higher grades in the course, but this is most likely due to prior characteristics as our data do not suggest that this is a causal relationship.},

This calls for replication of studies and reexamination of findings from pre-GenAI CS contexts to understand the impact on students. Objectives: Achievement Goals are well studied in computing education and can be predictive of student interest and exam performance. The objective in this study is to compare findings from prior achievement goal studies in CS1 courses with new CS1 courses that emphasize the use of human-GenAI collaborative coding. Methods: In a CS1 course that integrates GenAI, we use linear regression to explore the relationship between achievement goals and prior experience on student interest, exam performance, and perceptions of GenAI. Results: As with prior findings in traditional CS1 classes, Mastery goals are correlated with interest in computing. Contradicting prior CS1 findings, normative goals are correlated with exam scores. Normative and mastery goals correlate with students’ perceptions of learning with GenAI. Mastery goals weakly correlate with reading and testing code output from GenAI.},

ChatGPT's usage in tasks such as solving assignments and exams has the potential to undermine students' learning outcomes and compromise academic integrity. This study adopts a quantitative approach to demonstrate the notable unreliability of ChatGPT in providing accurate answers to a wide range of questions within the field of undergraduate computer science. While the majority of existing research has concentrated on assessing the performance of Large Language Models in handling programming assignments, our study adopts a more comprehensive approach. Specifically, we evaluate various types of questions such as true/false, multi-choice, multi-select, short answer, long answer, design-based, and coding-related questions. Our evaluation highlights the potential consequences of students excessively relying on ChatGPT for the completion of assignments and exams, including self-sabotage. We conclude with a discussion on how can students and instructors constructively use ChatGPT and related tools to enhance the quality of instruction and the overall student experience.},

We further present our students' perspectives on the banning of ChatGPT in Italy, where the course was delivered. The NLP unit featured a lecture, an interactive session, and a practical assignment wherein students developed a smart assistant responsive to textual commands. Students, after creating their smart assistants, highlighted challenges such as inadequate training datasets and natural language ambiguity. Opinions on ChatGPT's ban varied, with privacy concerns prevailing. However, a consensus emerged in favor of educational efforts to raise awareness about technology limitations, advocating understanding over outright bans in anticipation of their inevitable integration into daily life.},

abstract = {LLM-based chatbots enable students to get immediate, interactive help on homework assignments, but even a thoughtfully-designed bot may not serve all pedagogical goals. We report here on the development and deployment of a GPT-4-based interactive homework assistant ("61A Bot'') for students in a large CS1 course; over 2000 students made over 100,000 requests of our Bot across two semesters. Our assistant offers one-shot, contextual feedback within the command-line "autograder'' students use to test their code. Our Bot wraps student code in a custom prompt that supports our pedagogical goals and avoids providing solutions directly. Analyzing student feedback, questions, and autograder data, we find reductions in homework-related question rates in our course forum, as well as reductions in homework completion time when our Bot is available. For students in the 50th -80th percentile, reductions can exceed 30 minutes per assignment, up to 50\% less time than students at the same percentile rank in prior semesters. Finally, we discuss these observations, potential impacts on student learning, and other potential costs and benefits of AI assistance in CS1.},

abstract = {The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has transformed research and practice across a wide range of domains. Within the computing education research (CER) domain, LLMs have garnered significant attention, particularly in the context of learning programming. Much of the work on LLMs in CER, however, has focused on applying and evaluating proprietary models. In this article, we evaluate the efficiency of open-source LLMs in generating high-quality feedback for programming assignments and judging the quality of programming feedback, contrasting the results with proprietary models. Our evaluations on a dataset of students' submissions to introductory Python programming exercises suggest that state-of-the-art open-source LLMs are nearly on par with proprietary models in both generating and assessing programming feedback. Additionally, we demonstrate the efficiency of smaller LLMs in these tasks and highlight the wide range of LLMs accessible, even for free, to educators and practitioners.},

abstract = {Generative AI models, specifically large language models (LLMs), have made strides towards the long-standing goal of text-to-code generation. This progress has invited numerous studies of user interaction. However, less is known about the struggles and strategies of non-experts, for whom each step of the text-to-code problem presents challenges: describing their intent in natural language, evaluating the correctness of generated code, and editing prompts when the generated code is incorrect. This paper presents a large-scale controlled study of how 120 beginning coders across three academic institutions approach writing and editing prompts. A novel experimental design allows us to target specific steps in the text-to-code process and reveals that beginners struggle with writing and editing prompts, even for problems at their skill level and when correctness is automatically determined. Our mixed-methods evaluation provides insight into student processes and perceptions with key implications for non-expert Code LLM use within and outside of education.},

abstract = {In recent times, the term AI ethics caught the attention among the academics, legislators, developers, and among AI users to promote ethical AI development. While countries in the North have led the way in discussions about the direction of ethical and responsible artificial intelligence development and deployment, perspectives from developing countries like Bangladesh are underrepresented. Based on 32 qualitative interviews with different stakeholders, including machine learning practitioners, academic researchers, and policymakers in the emerging AI ecosystem in Bangladesh, this work closely examines the ongoing challenges and opportunities to ensure AI ethics in Bangladesh with emerging AI usage. In Bangladesh, the government has not yet fully implemented measures to empower citizens with AI-related skills, policies, resources, and data ethics, and a significant portion of the population lacks knowledge in AI. In this paper, we are presenting the findings of AI4Bangladesh project that intend to create the roadmap for ethical AI in Bangladesh. We outline the core challenges, present situation, and risks of AI for Bangladesh; propose seven AI ethics principles, and offer suggestions to ensure a transparent, accountable, and fair AI ecosystem for Bangladesh.},

abstract = {As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain in popularity, it is important to understand how novice programmers use them and the effect they have on learning to code. We present the results of a thematic analysis on a data set from 33 learners, aged 10-17, as they independently learned Python by working on 45 code-authoring tasks with access to an AI Code Generator based on OpenAI Codex. We explore several important questions related to how learners used LLM-based AI code generators, and provide an analysis of the properties of the written prompts and the resulting AI generated code. Specifically, we explore (A) the context in which learners use Codex, (B) what learners are asking from Codex in terms of syntax and logic, (C) properties of prompts written by learners in terms of relation to task description, language, clarity, and prompt crafting patterns, (D) properties of the AI-generated code in terms of correctness, complexity, and accuracy, and (E) how learners utilize AI-generated code in terms of placement, verification, and manual modifications. Furthermore, our analysis reveals four distinct coding approaches when writing code with an AI code generator: AI Single Prompt, where learners prompted Codex once to generate the entire solution to a task; AI Step-by-Step, where learners divided the problem into parts and used Codex to generate each part; Hybrid, where learners wrote some of the code themselves and used Codex to generate others; and Manual coding, where learners wrote the code themselves. Our findings reveal consistently positive trends between learners’ utilization of the Hybrid coding approach and their post-test evaluation scores, while showing consistent negative trends between the AI Single Prompt and the post-test evaluation scores. Furthermore, we offer insights into novice learners’ use of AI code generators in a self-paced learning environment, highlighting signs of over-reliance, self-regulation, and opportunities for enhancing AI-assisted learning tools.},

Ever since the emergence of large language models (LLMs), their potential to generate formative feedback for introductory programming courses has been extensively researched. However, most of these studies have focused on Python. In this work, we examine the bug-fixing and feedback-generation abilities of Code Llama and ChatGPT for Java programming assignments using our new Java benchmark called CodeWBugs. The results indicate that ChatGPT performs reasonably well, and was able to fix 94.33\% programs. By comparison, we observed high variability in the results from Code Llama. We further analyzed the impact of different types of prompts and observed that prompts that included task descriptions and test inputs yielded better results. In most cases, the LLMs precisely localized the bugs and also offered guidance on how to proceed. Nevertheless, we also noticed incorrect responses generated by the LLMs, emphasizing the need to validate responses before disseminating feedback to learners.},

Advancements in large language models (LLMs) enable generating analogies, yet their effectiveness in education remains underexplored. In this paper, we first conducted a two-stage study involving high school students and teachers to assess the effectiveness of LLM-generated analogies in biology and physics through a controlled in-class test and a classroom field study. Test results suggested that LLM-generated analogies could enhance student understanding particularly in biology, but require teachers’ guidance to prevent over-reliance and overconfidence. Classroom experiments suggested that teachers could refine LLM-generated analogies to their satisfaction and inspire new analogies from generated ones, encouraged by positive classroom feedback and homework performance boosts. Based on findings, we developed and evaluated a practical system to help teachers generate and refine teaching analogies. We discussed future directions for developing and evaluating LLM-supported teaching and learning by analogy.},

One of the courses focused on software engineering with LLMs, while the two other courses were not directly related to LLMs. The chatbot used OpenAI GPT-4 without additional filters or system prompts.  Our results suggest that only a minority of students engage with the chatbot in the courses that do not relate to LLMs. At the same time, unsurprisingly, nearly all students in the LLM-focused course leveraged the chatbot. In all courses, the majority of the chatbot usage came from a few superusers, whereas the majority of the students did not heavily use the chatbot even though it effectively provided free access to OpenAI's GPT-4 model (which would have otherwise required a paid subscription at the time of the study). We observe that in addition to students using the chatbot for course-specific purposes, many use the chatbot for their own purposes.  Overall, our results suggest that the worst fears of educators -- all students overrelying on chatbots -- did not materialize. Finally, we discuss potential reasons for low usage, including the need for more tailored and scaffolded chatbot experiences targeted for specific types of use cases.},

abstract = {Over the past year (2022–2023), recently-released AI tools such as ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot have gained significant attention from computing educators. Both researchers and practitioners have discovered that these tools can generate correct solutions to a variety of introductory programming assignments and accurately explain the contents of code. Given their current capabilities and likely advances in the coming years, how do university instructors plan to adapt their courses to ensure that students still learn well? To gather a diverse sample of perspectives, we interviewed 20 introductory programming instructors (9 women + 11 men) across 9 countries (Australia, Botswana, Canada, Chile, China, Rwanda, Spain, Switzerland, United States) spanning all 6 populated continents. To our knowledge, this is the first empirical study to gather instructor perspectives about how they plan to adapt to these AI coding tools that more students will likely have access to in the future. We found that, in the short-term, many planned to take immediate measures to discourage AI-assisted cheating. Then opinions diverged about how to work with AI coding tools longer-term, with one side wanting to ban them and continue teaching programming fundamentals, and the other side wanting to integrate them into courses to prepare students for future jobs. Our study findings capture a rare snapshot in time in early 2023 as computing instructors are just starting to form opinions about this fast-growing phenomenon but have not yet converged to any consensus about best practices. Using these findings as inspiration, we synthesized a diverse set of open research questions regarding how to develop, deploy, and evaluate AI coding tools for computing education.},

abstract = {Reasoning about code and explaining its purpose are fundamental skills for computer scientists. There has been extensive research in the field of computing education on the relationship between a student's ability to explain code and other skills such as writing and tracing code. In particular, the ability to describe at a high-level of abstraction how code will behave over all possible inputs correlates strongly with code writing skills. However, developing the expertise to comprehend and explain code accurately and succinctly is a challenge for many students. Existing pedagogical approaches that scaffold the ability to explain code, such as producing exemplar code explanations on demand, do not currently scale well to large classrooms. The recent emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) may offer a solution. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLMs in generating explanations that can serve as examples to scaffold students' ability to understand and explain code. To evaluate LLM-created explanations, we compare them with explanations created by students in a large course (n ≈ 1000) with respect to accuracy, understandability and length. We find that LLM-created explanations, which can be produced automatically on demand, are rated as being significantly easier to understand and more accurate summaries of code than student-created explanations. We discuss the significance of this finding, and suggest how such models can be incorporated into introductory programming education.},

For the second, we created a database of sample ToC questions and responses to accommodate other ToC offerings' choices for topics and structure. We scored each of ChatGPT's outputs on these questions. Overall, we determined that ChatGPT can pass our ToC course, and is adequate at understanding common formal definitions and answering "simple''-style questions, e.g., true/false and multiple choice. However, ChatGPT often makes nonsensical claims in open-ended responses, such as proofs.},

abstract = {Reading, understanding and explaining code have traditionally been important skills for novices learning programming. As large language models (LLMs) become prevalent, these foundational skills are more important than ever given the increasing need to understand and evaluate model-generated code. Brand new skills are also needed, such as the ability to formulate clear prompts that can elicit intended code from an LLM. Thus, there is great interest in integrating pedagogical approaches for the development of both traditional coding competencies and the novel skills required to interact with LLMs. One effective way to develop and assess code comprehension ability is with "Explain in plain English'' (EiPE) questions, where students succinctly explain the purpose of a fragment of code. However, grading EiPE questions has always been difficult given the subjective nature of evaluating written explanations and this has stifled their uptake. In this paper, we explore a natural synergy between EiPE questions and code-generating LLMs to overcome this limitation. We propose using an LLM to generate code based on students' responses to EiPE questions -- not only enabling EiPE responses to be assessed automatically, but helping students develop essential code comprehension and prompt crafting skills in parallel. We investigate this idea in an introductory programming course and report student success in creating effective prompts for solving EiPE questions. We also examine student perceptions of this activity and how it influences their views on the use of LLMs for aiding and assessing learning.},

In a within-subject study (N = 18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users’ awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes.

An important skill for new university graduates to possess will be the ability to use such LLMs to effectively navigate and modify a large code base. While much of the prior work related to LLMs in computing education focuses on novice programmers learning to code, less work has focused on how upper-division students use and trust these tools, especially while working with large code bases. In this study, we taught students about various GitHub Copilot features, including Copilot chat, in an upper-division software engineering course and asked students to add a feature to a large code base using Copilot. Our analysis revealed a novel interaction pattern that we call one-shot prompting, in which students ask Copilot to implement the entire feature at once and spend the next few prompts asking Copilot to debug the code or asking Copilot to regenerate its incorrect response. Finally, students reported significantly more trust in the code comprehension features than code generation features of Copilot, perhaps due to the presence of trust affordances in the Copilot chat that are absent in the code generation features. Our study takes the first steps in understanding how upper-division students use Github Copilot so that our instruction can adequately prepare students for a career in software engineering.},

What if we could make the teacher training experience more engaging and, as a downstream effect, reduce the potential for harm that teachers-in-training could inflict on students? We present GPTeach, an interactive chat-based teacher training tool that allows novice teachers to practice with simulated students. We performed two studies to evaluate GPTeach: one think-aloud study and one A/B test between our tool and a baseline. Participants took the role of a teaching assistant conducting office hours with two GPT-simulated students. We found that our tool provides the opportunity for teachers to get valuable teaching practice without the pressures of affecting real students, allowing them to iterate their responses both during and across sessions. Additionally, participants enjoyed flexibility in tailoring their responses according to the varied personas, needs, and learning goals. In this paper, we provide quantitative results and qualitative observations to inform future work in this area. We conclude with a discussion of actionable design ideas for such systems, as well as other ways to use this tool for evaluating teachers and students. GPTeach has recently been deployed into the teacher training component of an online course with over 800 novice teachers.},

This study investigates the performance of ChatGPT-4 Vision, OpenAI’s most advanced visual model at the time the study was conducted, on the Bachelor in Computer Science section of Brazil’s 2021 National Undergraduate Exam (ENADE). By presenting the model with the exam’s open and multiple-choice questions in their original image format and allowing for reassessment in response to differing answer keys, we were able to evaluate the model’s reasoning and self-reflecting capabilities in a large-scale academic assessment involving textual and visual content. ChatGPT-4 Vision significantly outperformed the average exam participant, positioning itself within the top 10 best score percentile. While it excelled in questions that incorporated visual elements, it also encountered challenges with question interpretation, logical reasoning, and visual acuity. A positive correlation between the model’s performance in multiple-choice questions and the performance distribution of the human participants suggests multimodal LLMs can provide a useful tool for question testing and refinement. However, the involvement of an independent expert panel to review cases of disagreement between the model and the answer key revealed some poorly constructed questions containing vague or ambiguous statements, calling attention to the critical need for improved question design in future exams. Our findings suggest that while ChatGPT-4 Vision shows promise in multimodal academic evaluations, human oversight remains crucial for verifying the model’s accuracy and ensuring the fairness of high-stakes educational exams.

abstract = {This paper presents a case study that evaluates the effectiveness of coding Large Language Models (LLMs) in introductory computer science courses at the university level. The study assesses six different AI-powered code generators. The evaluation focuses on the accuracy of these AI code generators in solving ten programming problems from a set of problems that instructors at Duke University can assign to students for weekly completion. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of coding LLMs in solving these problems.Based on the findings, the paper discusses the challenges faced by the computer science education community and potential strategies to address them. The advent of coding LLMs poses significant challenges to traditional teaching and learning methods in computer science. These challenges include the need for strategies to mitigate any negative impact of LLMs on the learning process. At the same time, these code LLMs also offer tremendous opportunities for enhancing teaching and learning.},

abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have become widely popular for various software engineering tasks, including programming, testing, code review, and program comprehension. However, their impact on improving software quality in educational settings remains uncertain. This article explores our experience teaching the use of Programming Mistake Detector (PMD) to foster a culture of bug fixing and leverage LLM to improve software quality in the classroom. This article discusses the results of an experiment involving 155 submissions that carried out a code review activity of 1,658 rules. Our quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that a set of PMD quality issues influences the acceptance or rejection of the issues, and design-related categories that take longer to resolve. Although students acknowledge the potential of using ChatGPT during code review, some skepticism persists. Further, constructing prompts for ChatGPT that possess clarity, complexity, and context nurtures vital learning outcomes, such as enhanced critical thinking, and among the 1,658 issues analyzed, 93\% of students indicated that ChatGPT did not identify any additional issues beyond those detected by PMD. Conversations between students and ChatGPT encompass five categories, including ChatGPT’s use of affirmation phrases like “certainly” regarding bug fixing decisions, and apology phrases such as “apologize” when resolving challenges. Through this experiment, we demonstrate that code review can become an integral part of the educational computing curriculum. We envision our findings to enable educators to support students with effective code review strategies, increasing awareness of LLMs, and promoting software quality in education.},

abstract = {Cheating has been a long-standing issue in university assessments. However, the release of ChatGPT and other free-to-use generative AI tools has provided a new and distinct method for cheating. Students can run many assessment questions through the tool and generate a superficially compelling answer, which may or may not be accurate.&nbsp;We ran a dual-anonymous “quality assurance” marking exercise across four end-of-module assessments across a distance university computer science (CS) curriculum. Each marker received five ChatGPT-generated scripts alongside 10 student scripts. A total of 90 scripts were marked; every ChatGPT-generated script for the undergraduate modules received at least a passing grade (&gt;40\%), with all of the introductory module CS1 scripts receiving a distinction (&gt;85\%). None of the ChatGPT-taught postgraduate scripts received a passing grade (&gt;50\%). We also present the results of interviewing the markers and of running our sample scripts through a GPT-2 detector and the TurnItIn AI detector, which both identified every ChatGPT-generated script but differed in the number of false positives. As such, we contribute a baseline understanding of how the public release of generative AI is likely to significantly impact quality assurance processes. Our analysis demonstrates that in most cases, across a range of question formats, topics, and study levels, ChatGPT is at least capable of producing adequate answers for undergraduate assessment.},

abstract = {Large language models are increasingly applied in real-world scenarios, including research and education. These models, however, come with well-known ethical issues, which may manifest in unexpected ways in human-computer interaction research due to the extensive engagement with human subjects. This paper reports on research practices related to LLM use, drawing on 16 semi-structured interviews and a survey with 50 HCI researchers. We discuss the ways in which LLMs are already being utilized throughout the entire HCI research pipeline, from ideation to system development and paper writing. While researchers described nuanced understandings of ethical issues, they were rarely or only partially able to identify and address those ethical concerns in their own projects. This lack of action and reliance on workarounds was explained through the perceived lack of control and distributed responsibility in the LLM supply chain, the conditional nature of engaging with ethics, and competing priorities. Finally, we reflect on the implications of our findings and present opportunities to shape emerging norms of engaging with large language models in HCI research.},
