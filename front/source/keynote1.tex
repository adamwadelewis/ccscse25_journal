\maketitle

This keynote presents an analysis of two decades of programming contests
hosted by the CCSC Southeast. Drawing on his experience as director
since 2004, Andy Digh will identify five recurring problem categories:
string manipulation, mathematical computation, search and data
structures, graph algorithms, and problems requiring high implementation
complexity. The talk will reveal a correlation between Python usage and
higher success rates, attributed to its efficiency in development and
debugging. Key contest strategies—including effective teamwork, problem
selection, and time management—will be highlighted, alongside
preparation methods used by top-performing teams. In addition, the
future impact of AI and new programming languages on these competitions
will be considered.
